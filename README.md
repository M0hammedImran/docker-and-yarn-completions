# docker-and-yarn-completions

I got docker completion scripts from official docker/cli repo <https://github.com/docker/cli/tree/master/contrib/completion/zsh>

I got yarn completion scripts from <https://github.com/chrisands/zsh-yarn-completions>

I just need it to follow a naming convention for easy of use.
